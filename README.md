## Changes

- Major update: The Alibre Help GPT now returns Alibre Help URLs that match your prompts! Currently testing responses.
- Added the URLs of Alibre Script files from GitHub to the GPT data. Now you can ask about scripts, and the GPT can find the links. You can paste script code in the same chat for help.
- Added YouTube video data. You can now ask for videos. The data is current as of 05-11-2024, so newer videos won't be included automatically.
- Added instructions to the GPT to include the sources of the results. You can ask for the data sources.
- Improved error handling
